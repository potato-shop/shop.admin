            SimpleBar does only one thing: replace the browser's default scrollbar
            with a custom CSS-styled one without losing performances.
            Unlike some popular plugins, SimpleBar doesn't mimic scroll with
            Javascript, causing janks and strange scrolling behaviours...
            You keep the awesomeness of native scrolling...with a custom scrollbar!
            <p>SimpleBar <strong>does NOT implement a custom scroll
                behaviour</strong>. It keeps the <strong>native</strong>
              <code>overflow: auto</code> scroll and <strong>only</strong> replace
              the scrollbar visual appearance.
            </p>
            <h5>Design it as you want</h5>
            <p>SimpleBar uses pure CSS to style the scrollbar. You can easily
              customize it as you want! Or even have multiple style on the same
              page...or just keep the default style ("Mac OS" scrollbar style).

            <p>Only 6kb minified. SimpleBar doesn't use Javascript to handle
